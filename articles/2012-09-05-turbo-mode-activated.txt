Emanuel and I had quite a crazy week. We received an offer from the ceo of our job for profit shares and decent bonuses over time in exchange for our total focus in the company. It also meant that we would have to let SynApps go, as our current 4 days - 30h /week was not enough anymore. We turned down the offer and it resulted in us getting fired. After a bit of thinking, we decided to take the Synapps train and bet that we can make the business sustainable.

#### On a side note
We wanted to try the uberman sleep schedule for a long time. Now that we are jobless, the timing can not be better.  
So we started under the close supervision of Linh, his girlfriend. ;)

#### Propaganda
We also started tweeting about burndown-charts and trackman and are receiving more feedbacks from users than ever.  
This is making us realize that we must learn how to market if we want this to work.   
Thanks to Sabiha for raising our awareness on this one.

_All in all, I really think that what we are doing is the right thing and everything could not align better for us._
