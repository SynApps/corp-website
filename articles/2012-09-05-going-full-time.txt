Emanuel and I had quite a crazy week. We turned down an offer to go all-in from the ceo of our job in exchange for company shares and decent bonuses over time. It also meant that we would have to let SynApps go, as all our efforts would be focused on our job. This resulted in us getting fired and after a bit of thinking, we decided to take the Synapps train and try to build something sustainable.

On the same note, we discussed for a long time about trying the uberman sleep schedule. The timing was there so we started together under the close supervision of Linh, his girlfriend. ;)

At the same time, we started tweeting about burndown-charts and trackman and are receiving more feedbacks than ever. 

This is quite encouraging.
